# Task Execution Approach

> **This document has been refactored into a Claude Skill.**
>
> The full task execution workflow, commit conventions, validation checklists, and deployment procedures now live at:
>
> **`.claude/skills/homelab-task-execution/SKILL.md`**
>
> Reference files:
> - `.claude/skills/homelab-task-execution/references/validation-checklists.md`
> - `.claude/skills/homelab-task-execution/references/production-deployment.md`
>
> Claude will automatically load and follow these practices when executing tasks in this project.
